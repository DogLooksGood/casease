;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode help input symbols in variant cases without pressing the shift key.
;; By inserting a prefix char(see `casease-entry-alist'), your input will be converted to
;; corresponding case automatically. The words can always be separated by whitespaces.
;;
;; The conversion will stop once your cursor leaving the highlight or you give a non alphanum input.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   1. configure entry prefix by customize `casease-entry-alist'.
;;   2. enable caseease-mode.
;;
;; Currently, four cases are supported:
;; - snake_case
;; - PascalCase
;; - camelCase
;; - SCREAM_CASE
;; - kebab-case
;;
;; Performance:
;;   casease add hook to `post-self-insert-hook', the cost for hook function is depending on how complex the rules are, but usually less than 0.1ms.

:separator is the key to separate words during input.
This is optional, when not provided, the default `casease-separator-key' will be used.
This separator will also be added to `casease-input-keys'.

:inputs is a list of keys, they are add to buffer local `casease-input-keys'.
The original keys contains [a-z][0-9], you don't have to specify.

:commands is a list of command names, those will extend the conversion area.
The original commands contains `self-insert-command', you don't have to specify.

:entries is the rules for starting conversion.

Example usage:
\(casease-setup

   :separator ?-
   :inputs (?/)
   :commands (cljr-slash)
   :entries
   ((pascal \"\\(-\\)[a-z]\")

In this example, we enable pascal case with prefix hyphen.
And \"(.\" is leading to an camel case.

We also add / character as extra keys those continue the conversion,
and we don't let cljr-slash command quit the conversion."
